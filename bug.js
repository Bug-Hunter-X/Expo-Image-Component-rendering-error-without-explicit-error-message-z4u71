This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  It can manifest in different ways, sometimes without a clear error message in the console.  The image simply won't render.  This is especially tricky to debug because standard debugging methods might not reveal the root cause.  A common reason is an incorrect URI, especially when working with dynamic image sources where there might be typos or unexpected values. Another potential cause is a network issue where the image source is unreachable due to problems with the server or network connectivity. Improper use of caching mechanisms might also lead to such issues.
